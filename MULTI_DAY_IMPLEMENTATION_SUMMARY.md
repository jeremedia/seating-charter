### Advanced Parameters
- **Interaction Penalty Weight** (0.5-5.0): How strongly to avoid repeated interactions
- **Diversity Weight** (0.1-2.0): Importance of attribute diversity within each day
- **Stability Weight** (0.0-1.0): Balance between change and familiarity
- **Manual Adjustments**: Allow post-optimization manual changes

### Day-Specific Configuration

- **Absent Students**: Track student availability per day
- **Special Constraints**: Day-specific seating requirements
- **Constraint Types**: Keep groups together, separate individuals, etc.
