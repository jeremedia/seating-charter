## Integration Points

### Optimization Service Integration
The `SeatingOptimizationService` has been enhanced to integrate with decision logging:

```ruby
# Initialize decision logging
decision_logger = DecisionLogService.new(seating_event)

# Log each iteration with acceptance reasoning
decision_logger.log_iteration(
  iteration: iterations,
  current_arrangement: current_arrangement,
  current_score: current_score,
  new_arrangement: new_arrangement,
  new_score: adjusted_score,
  accepted: accepted,
  reason: determine_acceptance_reason(current_score, adjusted_score, accepted)
)
```
